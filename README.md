# Data Engineering Interview Tests

This repository contains former tests used at interview by the Ministry of Justice Data Engineering team. This repo will be maintained over time with the addition of new coding tests once recruitment rounds end. Each test will have a README that explains the conditions each test would be taken under (time, coding languages, etc.).
